            <h1>Why go solar?</h1>
            <p>
                The demand for renewable energy solutions is increasing, driven by
                environmental concerns and government incentives for solar energy adoption.
                The U.S. Government has a very aggressive plan for the country which involves a 50% electric vehicle
                adoption by the year 2030, however the infrastructure cannot support this number of electric
                vehicles, thereby creating a greater demand for affordable home energy.
